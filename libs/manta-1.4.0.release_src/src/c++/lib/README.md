# Libraries

- alignment
  - sequence alignment utilities

- applications/X:
  - code specific to command-line application X

- appstats
  - shared performance tracking code between applications

- assembly
  - local sequence assembly utilities

- blt\_util
  - general utility functions from manta/starling/strelka/gvcftools

- common
  - general utility functions from CASAVA/Grouper/Isaac

- format
  - conversion of data into external formats

- htsapi
  - various c++ wrapper objects built on top of samtools/htslib and other utilities for standard genomic indexed file formats like bam/cram,bed,vcf, etc...

- manta
  - common code to the manta project (ie. too specific for general utility libraries but does not fit the category of another library). This is also the default library to which logic should be added until there is a clear pattern to justify a new library.

- options
  - command-line options objects which are shared between applications

- svgraph
  - SV locus graph components

- test
  - Logic used only for unit testing other libraries. These are linked into the unit tests but not production binaries
