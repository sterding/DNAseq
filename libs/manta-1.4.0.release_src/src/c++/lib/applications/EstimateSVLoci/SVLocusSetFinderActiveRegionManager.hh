/// SVLocusSetFinder is designed to be used by scanning regions of the genome left ot right. Certain data structures

/// functions at a defined positional offset less than the position of the most recent
/// read alignment input. These offset functions will (1) trigger the inline graph denoising
/// process (2) clean up buffered read depth data after it is no longer needed.
